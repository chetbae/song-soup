# [SONGSOUP](https://song-soup.glitch.me/) 

Architected with Node.js, express, HTML/CSS, and hosted on Glitch. Calling on the Spotify API to authenticate users and display pertinent information (in a pretty display). 

## Design
The color scheme was picked on a whim after watching this incredible video on Alex Megos. Other than that, the rest was inspired by the spotify rewinds.
